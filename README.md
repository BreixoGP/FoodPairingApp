FoodPairingApp is an application thought as a final project for a cross-platform application development course.
The main idea is for users to select one or more ingredients and discover which food combinations work best together.

The project is structured as a client-server system:
Server: REST API implemented with Django, responsible for managing users, ingredients, and generating pairing recommendations.
Client: Android application that consumes the API endpoints to display pairings to the user.
Features:
User registration and authentication.
Ingredient and flavor profile management.
Register ingredient variants with different cooking methods (raw, roasted, etc.) and flavor profiles.
Query recommended pairings based on ingredients selected by the user.



The project aims to simulate a culinary pairing recommendation system, helping users discover flavors that go well together in a practical and scalable way.
